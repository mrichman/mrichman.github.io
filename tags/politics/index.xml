      <description>If a conservative doesn&amp;#8217;t like guns, he doesn&amp;#8217;t buy one.
If a liberal doesn&amp;#8217;t like guns, he wants all guns outlawed.
If a conservative is a vegetarian, he doesn&amp;#8217;t eat meat.
If a liberal is a vegetarian, he wants all meat products banned for everyone.
If a conservative sees a foreign threat, he thinks about how to defeat his enemy.
A liberal wonders how to surrender gracefully and still look good.</description>

      <description>I thought this piece (Weineg, 2004) was so &amp;#8220;on the money&amp;#8221;, four years ago, that I am reposting it again this election year&amp;#8230;and again on my mom&amp;#8217;s birthday ðŸ™‚Â Happy Birthday, Mom!
&amp;#8220;Growing up as an upper-middle class, Jewish boy in New York City, I had almost no other choice than to pretend to be a liberal. My high school was a hippie nest. Instead of Fs, I got hugs if I didn&amp;#8217;t know how to spell my name.</description>

      <description>A young woman was about to finish her first year of college. Like so many others her age, she considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat, and among other liberal ideals, was very much in favor of higher taxes to support more government programs, in other words, redistribution of wealth.
She was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch Republican, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she felt that her father had for years harbored an evil, selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his.</description>
