      <description>Microsoft sucks. Java is dead. Rails can&amp;#8217;t scale. Python is slow. I&amp;#8217;ve heard it all, and I can tell you none of it matters.
Developers are an interesting breed; they tend to stick to what they know best, but also love to tinker with new technologies. These experiments often fail at the expense of a project&amp;#8217;s success, however.
Many of my clients struggle with technology choice for new projects. Business owners and executives are hesitant to try newer technologies, but by the same token don&amp;#8217;t want to be left driving an Edsel.</description>
