      <description>SOAP based web services and Cocoa have never been good friends, and although REST based webservices are fortunately today&amp;#8217;s standard there are still tons of SOAP-based ones out there. What has always been missing in Cocoa is high level support for interacting with SOAP-based webservices. Here I describe one way in which you can build such frameworks yourself, starting by analysing the webservice calls in detail in this part 1 and generating the necessary Cocoa classes for use in a Mac or iPhone application next time.</description>
