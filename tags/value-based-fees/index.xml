      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a quandary &amp;#8211; we, as value-based IT consultants, aspire to charge value-based fees for our services (how obvious!). We know that doing so requires tight scope control. As such, this often requires a detailed specification. However, this is the very waterfall model that the agile movement shuns. How do you reconcile scope control, customer satisfaction, and ever-changing requirements with value-based fees? I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s preferable &amp;#8211; or practical &amp;#8211; to do two week iterations on a value-based fee basis.</description>

      <description>Situation A: Is Faster Service Worth More?
Your computer is not working properly. You have tried to understand the problem and find a solution that you can implement yourself. Yet, after trying, you are no closer to a solution, you find the situation aggravating, and you decide that there’s no point in continuing to attempt fixing the problem yourself. Your time and attention are better spent on productive activities and should not be wasted on this computer problem any more.</description>

I. Qualifying the Prospect This is the process of determining whether the inquiry is appropriate for your business in terms of size, relevance, seriousness, and related factors. In other words, you don’t want to pursue a lead which can’t result in legitimate—and worthwhile—business.
Questions:
 Why do you think we might be a good match?
 Is there budget allocated for this project?</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;ve been reading my blog for any length of time, you know that I&amp;#8217;m an advocate of Value-Based Fees. In a nutshell, here is the value proposition to the prospective client:
 There is a cap on your investment. You know exactly what is to be spent and there are no surprises. There is never a &amp;#8220;meter running.&amp;#8221; You do not have to worry each time my help is requested that I might be here for an hour, a day, or a week.</description>

      <description>Part two of my online discussions with David Winch:-
&amp;#8220;While I understand the concept behind value-based fees, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to wrap my head around how to apply them to what I consider highly commoditized services. That is not to say I devalue my own worth, but I do recognize that there is an upper bound to what someone is willing to pay for a service, regardless of ROI &amp;#8211; price elasticity of demand.</description>
