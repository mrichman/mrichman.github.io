      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a quandary &amp;#8211; we, as value-based IT consultants, aspire to charge value-based fees for our services (how obvious!). We know that doing so requires tight scope control. As such, this often requires a detailed specification. However, this is the very &lt;a title=&#34;Waterfall Model&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;waterfall model&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a title=&#34;Agile Software Development&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;agile movement&lt;/a&gt; shuns. How do you reconcile &lt;a title=&#34;Scope Creep&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;scope control&lt;/a&gt;, customer satisfaction, and ever-changing requirements with value-based fees? I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s preferable &amp;#8211; or practical &amp;#8211; to do two week iterations on a value-based fee basis. Just as much as value-based fees benefit the client by not requiring them to make an investment decision every time they wish to engage you, they also may trap the consultant into having a value discussion/negotiation with the client for each iteration. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation A: Is Faster Service Worth More?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your computer is not working properly. You have tried to understand the problem and find a solution that you can implement yourself. Yet, after trying, you are no closer to a solution, you find the situation aggravating, and you decide that there’s no point in continuing to attempt fixing the problem yourself. Your time and attention are better spent on productive activities and should not be wasted on this computer problem any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer technician that you call asks a few questions then says to bring the computer in to his shop. He charges $60 per hour and predicts the computer ready in two business days. Once he has the computer, he will diagnose the problem then call you with an estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; As you consider not having your computer on hand for two business days, and the opportunities to use it productively that you must forego, would you be willing to pay more to have it fixed and back in use much sooner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If the computer technician ****offered to fix your computer within 24 hours, satisfaction guaranteed, for a fixed fee agreed in advance, how attractive would that be to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation B: Evaluating Your Next Car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and your spouse are shopping for a new car. Having visited a few car dealers, conducted research on the web, and spoken to a trusted person at your usual auto-service shop, you and your spouse have narrowed your search to two cars, both of which you have taken on a test drive together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; As you consider the value of each car, do you care how quickly or slowly either car was built, or how much time the manufacturer put into design &amp;amp; engineering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; As you consider the asking prices of the cars, does it matter to you how much time the car salesperson has spent on the sales process with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation C: the Value of a Salad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a restaurant, you order a supper salad. The menu says that the salad costs $7.99. As usual, you expect the salad to be served to you in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your order reaches the kitchen, the manager finds that the supply of tomatoes has gone too low. She sends somebody out to buy tomatoes so that your salad can include them. The errand runner breaks a sweat to get the tomatoes to the kitchen in time for your salad to be served with the rest of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your salad is served with the rest of the meal, and it is billed at $7.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; As you sit at your table waiting for your meal to be served (unaware of the restaurant’s tomato supply) does it matter to you if the kitchen’s supply of tomatoes has gone too low, causing the manager to send somebody out to buy more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If you knew about the low tomato supply and the decision to send somebody out to buy tomatoes, how would that affect your expectations about the timing of the meal being served or the amount billed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation D: How Much Trust When the Meter is Running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacquie has been self-employed as a graphic designer for four years. She has found that her prospective clients (for example to design new logos and use those logos in designing stationery) typically start the buying process by asking her, “How much?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her first year, Jacquie found this frustrating because she could not answer right away. She needed to learn each client’s needs and expectations before she could provide a reasonable estimate, and her estimates were based on how much of her time would be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she learned to redirect that question to gauge the scope of each new project. This allowed her to provide reasonable estimates and close sales. Still, from that first question until the client signed her estimate, there was always uncomfortable uncertainty and a sense of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seemed to be a problem of trust intrinsic to the pricing aspect of the sales process. For example, one prospective client said, “I understand that you’ll show me three logo options with samples of how they’ll look on stationery. I am then supposed to choose and you’ll proceed from there. But what if I don’t like any of them as-is and want you to adjust or mix-and-match before I approve one? Would your fees stay the same?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacquie dreaded this. If the client was not satisfied with her initial work, then she would have to charge more or make less money for her time and effort. Under the circumstances, neither possibility was welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She considered that she would have to improve her skill at developing trust. She also longed for a way to make buying from her easier – especially if she could avoid the tension involved in estimating and hoping to make a decent profit when working for clients whose need for her billable time could exceed their budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; What if Jacquie reviews her process for each type of project to establish a range of cost? This way, somebody interested in a new logo and stationery, for example, could ask, “How much?” and Jacquie could reply, “It would cost between X and Y dollars. Let’s discuss what you’d get.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; What if, in addition to replying as above when asked, “How much?” Jacquie would say, “If we can discuss how important it is to you, then we can fix the fees in advance with a satisfaction guarantee”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation E: Paying for the Solution – Not the Time It Takes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dexter is a management consultant with an accounting firm. He has been advising the owners, directors, and senior managers of various companies long enough that he typically begins formulating solutions to their problems during the initial stage of discovering the problem. Understanding that each situation is unique, Dexter still pays close attention throughout the discovery stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because he always brings to bear his years of experience, and because he has the expertise to “sometimes come up with a $10,000 solution in 10 minutes,” Dexter eschews the billable hour as unfair. Rather, his firm charges fixed fees, established up-front based on the client’s gauge of importance, and includes a satisfaction guarantee. When the scope of any project changes while underway, the fee is adjusted on the same basis – all in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; Would it still be more fair for Dexter’s firm to charge according to his time spent, with his rate per hour linked to his seniority?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; Should any other professions that apply experience and expertise to solve client problems also consider value-based fees, fixed up-front with a satisfaction guarantee, and accommodate any changes in scope by adjusting the fees?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation F: Fixing the Cost of a Pizza&lt;/strong&gt; ****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada, there is a great number of pizzerias. Even small towns typically have more than one pizza place. Though there are pizza chains, there is also a variety of independent pizzerias across the country. Despite the number and variety, the industry has certain standards for ordering and pricing, anywhere you go, based on size of pizza and number of toppings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Emile considered opening a pizzeria in Morocco, he had the opportunity to consider the Canadian model: standard sizes of pizza, each with its own basic price, then standard pricing for toppings, plus free delivery within a certain radius. Emile analyzed the pizza business and found that toppings do vary in cost to the pizzeria. He also found that, with the overhead to keep a pizza oven at operating temperature, the cost to bake a pizza would vary with size each and number per day. The cost of any one ingredient could also vary over time, as would the price of fuel for a delivery car. These all factored into Emile’s business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; How important is it to you to know how much a pizza will cost when you order it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If your pizza order today matches your pizza order from a month ago, do you consider it reasonable for the price to be the same, even if the pizzeria’s costs might have varied?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation G: Original, Custom Newsletters for Standard Prices&lt;/strong&gt; ****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert was a professional writer, not of screenplays or magazine articles, but of original custom newsletters. Despite his ability as a wordsmith in a range of contexts, the market consistently regarded him as a newsletter specialist and brought that business to him. Robert decided to embrace this reputation. The rationale behind his business model was simple: Give people what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He developed a business model that would always create original, authentic newsletters – best to maintain a credible connection between his clients and their readers – and in an apparent paradox, make profits charging standardized fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reputation for newsletters that had driven demand for his writing was based on reliably good writing with a degree of original authenticity that made his third-party authorship invisible. He trained and managed a small cohort of writers in his techniques also so that readers would assume the writing to be the issuer’s. Robert also ensured that each newsletter would have a look unique to the issuer. Then, each issue would be laid out with client-approved text and photos by the same person who designed the original template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert paid his writers and designers fixed fees and had them work under a contract that protected the business interests of all parties. Likewise, he charged his clients fixed fees under a purchase agreement that both encouraged decisive collaboration on newsletter contents and allowed the flexibility necessary to make each issue fulfil its potential as a timely reflection of the issuer-reader relationship. His purchase agreement even included a pay-upon-approval satisfaction guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; If you could have original, custom work performed for you by a small team of creative people with the security of fixed fees and a satisfaction guarantee, would you bypass low-cost, off-the-shelf alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If you were to read a newsletter that seems to be a generic, impersonal product with the name and photo of an individual pasted in, would you consider it worth much more to that individual to issue an original, custom newsletter like those Robert and his team create?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-qualifying-the-prospect&#34;&gt;I. Qualifying the Prospect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the process of determining whether the inquiry is appropriate for your business in terms of size, relevance, seriousness, and related factors. In other words, you don’t want to pursue a lead which can’t result in legitimate—and worthwhile—business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do you think we might be a good match?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there budget allocated for this project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How important is this need (on a scale of 1-10)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your timing to accomplish this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who, if anyone, is demanding that this be accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How soon are you willing to begin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you made a commitment to proceed, or are you still analyzing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your key decision criteria in choosing a resource?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you tried this before (will this be a continuing endeavor)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your organization seeking formal proposals for this work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Point: You want to determine whether the potential work is large enough for your involvement, relevant to your expertise, and near enough on the horizon to merit rapid responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-finding-the-economic-buyer&#34;&gt;II. Finding the Economic Buyer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic buyer is the person who can write a check in return for your value contribution. He or she is the ONLY buyer to be concerned about. Contrary to a great deal of poor advice, the economic buyer is virtually never in human resources, training, meeting planning, or related support areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whose budget will support this initiative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who can immediately approve this project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To whom will people look for support, approval, and credibility?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who controls the resources required to make this happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who has initiated this request?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will claim responsibility for the results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will be seen as the main sponsor and/or champion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have to seek anyone else’s approval?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will accept or reject proposals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you and I were to shake hands, could I begin tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Point: The larger the organization, the more the number of economic buyers. They need not be the CEO or owner, but must be able to authorize and produce payment. Committees are never economic buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-rebutting-objections&#34;&gt;III. Rebutting Objections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Obstacles are those terrible things you see when you take your eyes off the goal,” said philosopher Hannah More. Objections are a sign of interest. Turn them around to your benefit. Once you demolish objections, there is no longer a reason not to proceed in a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions (in responding to an economic buyer’s objections)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do you feel that way? (Get at the true cause.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we resolve this, can we then proceed? (Is this the sole objection?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But isn’t that exactly why you need me? (The reversal approach.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would satisfy you? (Make the buyer answer the objection.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can we do to overcome that? (Demonstrate joint accountability.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this unique? (Is there precedent for overcoming it?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the consequence? (Is it really serious or merely an annoyance?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that low probability? (Worry about likelihoods, not the remote.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shall I address that in the proposal? (Let’s focus on value.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does it even matter in light of the results? (The ROI is the point.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: Don’t be on the defensive by trying to slay each objection with your sword, or you’ll eventually fall on it. Embrace the buyer in the “solutions,” and demonstrate that some objections are insignificant when compared with benefits (e.g., there will always be some unhappy employees in any change effort).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;iv-establishing-objectives&#34;&gt;IV. Establishing Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectives are the outcomes which represent the client’s desired and improved conditions. They are never inputs (e.g., reports, focus groups, manuals) but rather always outputs (e.g., increased sales, reduced attrition, improved teamwork). Clear objectives prevent “scope creep” and enable a rational engagement and disengagement to take place, resulting in much greater consulting efficiency and profit margins. (Note that items IV, V, and VI—objectives, measures, and value—are the basis of conceptual agreement.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the ideal outcome you’d like to experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What results are you trying to accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What better product/service/customer condition are you seeking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are you seeking to do this (work/project/engagement)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would the operation be different as a result of this work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would be the return on investment (sales, assets, equity, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would image/repute/credibility be improved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What harm (e.g., stress, dysfunction, turf wars, etc.) would be alleviated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much would you gain on the competition as a result?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would your value proposition be improved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: Most buyers know what they want but not necessarily what they need. By pushing the buyer on the end results you are helping to articulate and formalize the client’s perceived benefits, thereby increasing your own value in the process. Without clear objectives you do not have a legitimate project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;v-establishing-metrics&#34;&gt;V. Establishing Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Metrics” are measures of progress toward the objectives, which enable you and the client to ascertain the rate and totality of success. They assign proper credit to you and your efforts, and also signify when the project is complete (objectives are met) and it is proper to disengage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will you know we’ve accomplished your intent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How, specifically, will the operation be different when we’re done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will you measure this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What indicators will you use to assess our progress?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who or what will report on our results (against the objectives)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you already have measures in place you intend to apply?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the rate of return (on sales, investment, etc.) that you seek?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will we know the public, employees, and/or customers perceive it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time we talk, what standard will tell us we’re progressing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you know it if you tripped over it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: Measures can be subjective, so long as you and the client agree on who is doing the measuring and how. For example, the buyer’s observation that he or she is called upon less to settle “turf” disputes and has fewer complaints from direct reports aimed at colleagues are valid measures for the objective of “improved teamwork.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vi-assessing-value&#34;&gt;VI. Assessing Value&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining the value of the project for the client’s organization is the most critical aspect of conceptual agreement and pre-proposal interaction. That’s because when the buyer stipulates to significant value, the fee is placed in proper perspective (ROI) and is seldom an issue of contention. Conversations with the buyer should always focus on value and never on fee or price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will these results mean for your organization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you assess the actual return (ROI, ROA, ROS, ROE, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would be the extent of the improvement (or correction)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will these results impact the bottom line?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the annualized savings (first year might be deceptive)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the intangible impact (e.g., on repute, safety, comfort, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you, personally, be better off or better supported?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the scope of the impact (on customers, employees, vendors)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How important is this compared to your overall responsibilities?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if this fails?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: Subjective value (stress alleviated) can be every bit as important as more tangible results (higher sales). Never settle for “Don’t worry, it’s important.” Find out how important, because that will dictate the acceptable fee range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vii-determining-the-budget-range&#34;&gt;VII. Determining the Budget Range&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too much guessing takes place in the absence of a general understanding about how much the prospect intends to invest (prior to understanding the full value proposition). In many cases, the budget is fixed and entirely inappropriate, and in others it represents a better understanding of the ROI than that of the consultant! (Don’t forget, this presupposes you’re talking to an economic buyer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you arrived at a budget or investment range for this project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are funds allocated, or must they be requested?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your expectation of investment required?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we don’t waste time, are there parameters to remain within?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you done this before, and at what investment level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are you able to authorize during this fiscal year?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I assume that a strong proposition will justify proper expenditure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much are you prepared to invest to gain these dramatic results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a dramatic return, will you consider a larger investment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s be frank: What are you willing to spend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: There is nothing wrong with exceeding the budget expectation if you muster a strong enough value proposition. But don’t even proceed with a proposal if the prospect has a seriously misguided expectation of the investment need, or simply has an inadequate, fixed budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;viii-preventing-unforeseen-obstacles&#34;&gt;VIII. Preventing Unforeseen Obstacles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As comedienne Gilda Radnor used to say, “It’s always something.” Inevitably, it seems, the best laid plains are undermined by objections, occurrences, and serendipity from left field. Fortunately, there are questions to establish some preventive actions against even the unforeseen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there anything we haven’t discussed which could get in the way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, what has occurred to derail potential projects like this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What haven’t I asked you that I should have about the environment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you estimate the probability is of our going forward?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you surprised by anything I’ve said or that we’ve agreed upon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, are you still going to make this decision yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, if anything, do you additionally need to hear from me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is anything likely to change in the organization in the near future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you awaiting the results of any other initiatives or decisions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I get this proposal to you tomorrow, how soon will you decide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: Make sure that your project isn’t contingent upon other events transpiring (or not transpiring). If the buyer is holding out on you, these questions will make it more difficult to dissemble. Build into your proposal benefits to outweigh the effects of any external factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ix-increasing-the-size-of-the-sale&#34;&gt;IX. Increasing the Size of the Sale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once conceptual agreement is gained, it makes sense to capitalize on the common ground and strive for the largest possible relationship. Most consultants don’t obtain larger contracts because they don’t ask for or suggest them. You can’t possibly lose anything attempting to increase the business at this juncture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you be amenable to my providing a variety of options?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this the only place (division, department, geography) applicable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it be wise to extend this through implementation and oversight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we plan to also coach key individuals essential to the project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you benefit from benchmarking against other firms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you also like an idea of what a retainer might look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there others in your position with like needs I should see?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do your subordinates possess the skills to support you appropriately?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we run focus groups/other sampling to test employee reactions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you like me to test customer response at various stages?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: If you don’t ask, you don’t get. Don’t throw everything including the kitchen sink into your proposal in an attempt to justify your fee. Instead, “unbundle” what you’re capable of providing and add them back in at additional fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;x-going-for-the-close&#34;&gt;X. Going for the Close&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home stretch, but not across the finish line. Runners who slow up at the approaching tape lose to someone else with a better late “kick.” Run through the tape at full speed by driving the conversation right through the close of the sale and the check clearing the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the proposal reflects our last discussions, how soon can we begin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it better to start immediately, or wait for the first of the month?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there anything at all preventing our working together at this point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How rapidly are you prepared to begin once you see the proposal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get the proposal tomorrow, can I call Friday at 10 for approval?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I’m here, should I begin some of the preliminary work today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you like to shake hands and get started, proposal to follow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you prefer a corporate check or to wire the funds electronically?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;May I allocate two days early next week to start my interviews?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we proceed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: There is never a better time than when you’re in front of the buyer and he or she is in agreement and excited about the project. Even without a proposal, beginning immediately “pours cement” on the conceptual agreement and greatly diminishes the possibility of being derailed by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xi-the-most-vital-question&#34;&gt;XI. The Most Vital Question&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the preceding 100 questions are actually based on the reaction to one question which we often fail to ask of the most difficult person of all. And unlike most of the prior inquiries, it’s a simple binary question, with a clear “yes or no” response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you believe it yourself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: The first sale is always to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/why-i-never-bill-by-the-hour/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve been reading my blog for any length of time, you know that I&amp;#8217;m an advocate of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470275847/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0470275847&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=markrich0a-20&#34;&gt;Value-Based Fees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=markrich0a-20&amp;#038;l=as2&amp;#038;o=1&amp;#038;a=0470275847&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34; /&gt;. In a nutshell, here is the value proposition to the prospective client:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a cap on your investment. You know exactly what is to be spent and there are no surprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is never a &amp;#8220;meter running.&amp;#8221; You do not have to worry each time my help is requested that I might be here for an hour, a day, or a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unfair to you to place you in the position of making an investment decision every time you may need my help. Otherwise, you&amp;#8217;re trying to determine the impossible: Is this an issue that justifies a $2,000 visit or a $500 phone call. No client should ever be in that position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your people should feel free to use my assistance and to ask for my help without feeling they have to go to someone for budgetary approval. This only makes them more resistant to sharing their views, and at best delays the flow of important information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I find additional work that was unanticipated but must be performed, I can do it without having to come to you for additional funds. In those instances, legitimate, additional work would otherwise be viewed as self-aggrandizing and an attempt to generate addition hours or days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you find additional, related work that must be done, you can freely request it without worry about increased costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall, set fee, in relation to the project outcomes to be delivered, is inevitably less of a proportional investment than hourly billing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If conditions change in your organization, you won&amp;#8217;t be in the difficult situation of having to request that the project be completed in less time. The quality approach is assured, since the fee is set and paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I decide that additional resources are necessary, there is no cost to you and I can employ additional help as I see fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the most uncomplicated way to work together. There will never be a debate about what is billable time (e.g., travel, report writing) or what should be done on site or off site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 0.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Determining Value-Based Fees for Software Projects, Part 2</title>
      <link>/determining-value-based-fees-for-software-projects-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2009 21:05:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>mark@markrichman.com (Mark Richman)</author>
      <guid>/determining-value-based-fees-for-software-projects-part-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part two of my online discussions with David Winch:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;While I understand the concept behind value-based fees, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to wrap my head around how to apply them to what I consider highly commoditized services. That is not to say I devalue my own worth, but I do recognize that there is an upper bound to what someone is willing to pay for a service, regardless of ROI &amp;#8211; price elasticity of demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At what point am I delivering a valuable service, expertise, information, guidance, and coaching, and at what point am I simply laboring to produce a relatively undifferentiated good (i.e. a presentation website)? I tend to think I do much more of the latter, unfortunately. Certainly, I can rattle off a unique value proposition to a prospect, but many will have shopped around before they talk to me and already have an expectation of what they will pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This brings me to my next hurdle. Assuming I have somehow navigated past the prospect&amp;#8217;s early push to hear a price quoted, I find that I get nervous asking for more money than I think is &amp;#8220;fair&amp;#8221; (whatever that means). Is it a lack of self esteem, or a sense of ethics run amok?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;what I consider highly commoditized services&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;It really doesn&amp;#8217;t matter what you consider! The client&amp;#8217;s perception is the only thing that counts!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;You are unique and provide a unique service, so it is only by your own lack of &amp;#8216;Sales Conversation&amp;#8217; skill that a client could be allowed to retain that impression of &amp;#8220;highly commoditized&amp;#8221;. If they do retain it, this just means you haven&amp;#8217;t done your selling job well enough!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;not to say I devalue my own worth&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not yours to devalue (although you could blow it completely!), and it&amp;#8217;s not your worth that matters! It&amp;#8217;s the client&amp;#8217;s perception of the worth of having their problem fixed that matters, coupled with your personal value to the client. This is where the &amp;#8216;Value Conversation&amp;#8217; needs to be heading. As I said previously this can take quite a large chunk of your sales conversation, and mustn&amp;#8217;t be truncated.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;there is an upper bound to what someone is willing to pay for a service, regardless of ROI&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;There is an upper bound, but based almost exclusively on ROI! Having enabled the client to articulate for themselves the true value of having their problem fixed, your fee will be seen as an investment on which they expect that return.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;A ROI of 20 to 1 sounds mightily attractive! 10 to 1 is still pretty good. Many consultants say they&amp;#8217;ll make a client at least three times their fee, but I think this is not desperately attractive. Less than 3 to 1 is certainly not a brilliant investment, even though it does make money. We are trying here to get a reaction of &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s a bargain!&amp;#8221;, so go for a high ROI.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;price elasticity of demand&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Re-read Alan Weiss&amp;#8217;s Value-Based Fees &amp;#8211; particularly the &amp;#8216;Supply-and-demand illogic&amp;#8217; section of chapter 2 (in my edition) on &amp;#8221;The lunacy of time-and-materials models&amp;#8217;. Alan explains brilliantly why the economists&amp;#8217; theories that apply to commodity markets don&amp;#8217;t apply to non-commodity markets such as you providing your services. &amp;#8220;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At what point am I delivering a valuable service etc&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Easy! When the client believes you are!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or &amp;#8220;laboring to produce a relatively undifferentiated good&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Easy again. Only when you allow them to think this way!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I tend to think I do much more of the latter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;At the risk of sounding repetitive, it&amp;#8217;s not about what you think! It&amp;#8217;s about what the client perceives and believes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can rattle off a unique value proposition to a prospect&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Do I sound like Elvis Presley continually saying &amp;#8220;one more time&amp;#8221; to the band? The client is the one who determines value! You have to allow the client sufficient time to reach this conclusion (generally with your guidance via your questions, but certainly not putting words into their mouth) for themselves, so &amp;#8216;rattling off&amp;#8217; is almost by definition not going to work. And your proposition comes almost at the end of the sales conversation &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s where that entire conversation has been heading all along &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s not even at the end of the value conversation. Re-read the rest of &amp;#8216;Value-Based Fees&amp;#8217;!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;already have an expectation of what they will pay&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;This is natural, but will be based on their perceived remedy to their perceived pain, turned into a commodity, and put out for the world to bid the lowest price for! If you hear &amp;#8220;that&amp;#8217;s too expensive&amp;#8221; this really translates as &amp;#8220;I haven&amp;#8217;t understood enough of the value of having my problem fixed in this way to see this as a bargain investment in order to achieve that return.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&amp;#8220;You need to get them to understand for themselves what is their fundamental problem; their &amp;#8216;underlying disease&amp;#8217; that is causing the &amp;#8216;symptoms&amp;#8217; or pains that they are experiencing. Once they understand, they can articulate it to themselves, and then to you, and then you can understand also!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful question is &amp;#8220;What keeps you awake at nights?&amp;#8221; I doubt the answer is lack of a website! Lack of profitable sales, maybe! You have to ask other value seeking questions first though.&amp;#8221;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;somehow navigated past the prospect&amp;#8217;s early push to hear a price quoted&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Well done for identifying this one. Client questions about your daily rate are designed (even if subconsciously on the client&amp;#8217;s behalf) to identify you as a supplier of commodities, and thus be suitable material for forcing into a price war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;There is only one way to get rid of the daily rate question and that is to say &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t have one!&amp;#8221; And mean it! If you&amp;#8217;re not charging for your time, why do you even need one in your head?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;It would be wrong to leave your answer there however. You need to continue along the lines of &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m quite prepared to quote my fee, at the appropriate time, later, but at the moment I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about your issues to do so. Please can we start/return to talking about the problems that are bugging you right now?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I get nervous asking for more money than I think is &amp;#8220;fair&amp;#8221; (whatever that means)&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Firstly you have to accept that backing winners at odds of 10 to 1, even 20 to 1, is more than &amp;#8216;fair&amp;#8217;! Secondly, everyone gets nervous when they see how they&amp;#8217;ve been undercharging in the past. [They&amp;#8217;ve also been under-delighting, which is why they&amp;#8217;ve been under-charging!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I know I was no exception, particularly in moving from &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll invoice you at the end of the project&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;My standard terms are 50% before I start and 50% after four weeks&amp;#8221;. Stating that my fee was five or ten thousand pounds instead of the two thousand I would have asked previously was less of an issue for me, but all of us have different types of nervousness.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is it a lack of self esteem, or a sense of ethics run amok&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Almost certainly it&amp;#8217;s a lack of self confidence! The good news is there are simple techniques for gaining confidence at this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;As we&amp;#8217;ve implied already, the toughest sell is to yourself. One technique that works for many people is to think of the highest fee you&amp;#8217;ve ever been able to charge, multiply it by five, and then look in the mirror and tell the face you see there &amp;#8220;My fee is x thousand dollars&amp;#8221;. Keep doing this until you can do it with a perfectly straight face and no hint of embarrassment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Confidence comes from practise, not further contemplation. If you can say it to yourself, you&amp;#8217;ll be fine in front of clients. And it gets easier every time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Do the value-based thing properly and effectively you&amp;#8217;re telling the client &amp;#8216;I know a horse that is absolutely guaranteed to win, but you can still place your bet at odds of 20 to 1.&amp;rsquo;&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David concluded by asking me, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;What is there to be embarrassed about in that?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
