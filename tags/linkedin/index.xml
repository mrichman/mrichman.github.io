      <description>I followed up on David Winch&amp;#8217;s last points with some more of my own:  &amp;#8220;Now, all I need is a few prospects on whom to practice! But I&amp;#8217;m sure &amp;#8216;how do I find clients?&amp;#8217; is a huge component of your workshop, so I do not presume to receive such a detailed response to that one.  &amp;#8220;It is quite obvious to me now that I have been trying to sell not only what I do, but very specifically how I do it (right down to promoting my toolset of choice).</description>

      <description>Part two of my online discussions with David Winch:-
&amp;#8220;While I understand the concept behind value-based fees, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to wrap my head around how to apply them to what I consider highly commoditized services. That is not to say I devalue my own worth, but I do recognize that there is an upper bound to what someone is willing to pay for a service, regardless of ROI &amp;#8211; price elasticity of demand.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago David Winch noticed me talking on Twitter about &amp;#8220;Determining Value-Based Fees for Software Projects&amp;#8221;
Specifically I said:
 &amp;#8220;While I generally agree that Value-Based Fees (a la Alan Weiss) are the best way to charge and get what you&amp;#8217;re worth as a consultant, I don&amp;#8217;t know how well this approach translates to the software development domain.
&amp;#8220;How do you determine value to the client without spending inordinate time performing requirements discovery and analysis?</description>
