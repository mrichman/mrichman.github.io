      <description>Your CFO hates my guts.
Well, not me personally; we’ve probably never met. But if he is anything like the CFOs at many of my client companies, he has reviewed the business case for a cloud migration and shot me a dirty look or two.
When working with tech execs on their cloud migration strategies, I find their CFOs often get involved early in the decision making process. This is a good thing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to easily deploy a Go web application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Go.
  If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, AWS Elastic Beanstalk lets you deploy your app to AWS, and it takes care of load balancing and auto-scaling for you.
No server configuration required at all.
It’s cool because it supports lots of platforms - Java, PHP, .NET, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Docker, and Go.
I like working with Go</description>

      <description>Most of my clients come to me for help escaping the hell of managing servers in a closet somewhere in their office, or in a colocation facility. They realized their data was far too critical to leave on-premises, risking data loss and security breaches. What’s more, if they needed to rapidly scale their operations to meet demand, it would take weeks to add capacity. In terms of cost, maintaining infrastructure hardware and having to pay network engineers to keep it all going quickly erodes profits.</description>

      <title>Hargo: Load Testing using .har files in Go</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time working with Visual Studio&amp;rsquo;s web performance tests. While it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use, it&amp;rsquo;s not as flexible or extensible as Apache JMeter. It&amp;rsquo;s also impossible to capture a browser session without Visual Studio; it&amp;rsquo;s format is proprietary.
Visual Studio online supports the use of .har files to drive cloud-based load tests, but again, there are limitations. First, you can only test systems open to the public internet.</description>

      <description>When working with clients on web application performance optimization, I often ask for a view of operational costs and overall profitability. Did your eyes just glaze over? Don’t fret. That’s the response I usually get!
The point of my question isn’t necessarily to see the numbers, but to drive home the point that poor web application performance not only increases the incidence of support requests, it also hits in other areas.</description>

      <description>I spent about a decade working in the web hosting industry. Optimizing systems to achieve multitenancy, high server density, and minimizing resource utilization was crucial to higher profits. However, many web and systems application developers pay little attention to resource consumption, or how this behavior can eat into a company’s bottom line.
Consider This&amp;hellip; The slower your application is, the less revenue you’re likely to derive from it. Pretty simple.</description>

      <description>Very often, I&amp;rsquo;m contacted by prospective clients who are seeking &amp;ldquo;help with &amp;lt;insert technology here&amp;gt;.&amp;rdquo; After some discussion, the truth often surfaces. While clients might want help with a particular technology, what they usually need is completely different.
Many of my best clients believed that implementing a popular technology, product, or process will cure all that ails them. In reality, it&amp;rsquo;s one of many possible team performance issues that require correction, and not a technology problem.</description>

      <description>What&amp;#8217;s preventing your ability to rapidly innovate?
Answer the following:
 How long does it take you to deliver even a single line of code change into production? How long does it take you to bring a new product to market? How often do you fail to meet commitments to both customers and business partners? Do you want to lower the cost of bringing your products to market? Do you have a deeper backlog of work than you have resources?</description>

      <description>When I was a kid, I loved Mister Rogers&amp;#8217; Neighborhood. My favorite character, aside from Mr. Rogers, of course, was Mr. McFeely, the Speedy Delivery man. Mr. McFeely&amp;#8217;s one and only job was to deliver life lessons in the form of parcels to the neighborhood. When working with my clients, I aspire to be like Mr. McFeely, helping to develop the people, processes, tools, and techniques to enable the speedy delivery of ever evolving solutions to their customers.</description>

      <description>This is a short story about two software development companies. Let&amp;#8217;s call them Alpha and Bravo. Both companies received an RFP (Request for Proposal) to develop custom help desk software. After careful review of the respective proposals, the client selects Alpha for the project. Six months to the day after signing the contract, Alpha delivers exactly what was proposed. However, the client is very unhappy.
During the course of development, the client discovered additional features which Alpha failed to include in the final product.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re anything like my clients, you spend a lot of time trying to do these two things:
 Maximize the productivity of your limited staff Maximize the performance of your software systems  As your business grows, both problems become increasingly difficult &amp;#8211; and expensive &amp;#8211; to solve.
Right now, I want to address the first point &amp;#8211; your team.
Extensive research has shown that productivity drains are a direct result of inefficient processes.</description>

      <description>My clients, just like you, want to enable faster, better delivery of value. I&amp;#8217;ve helped these organizations scale and improve their operations through agile delivery, achieving continuous innovation of their products. I write and speak a lot about the people, processes, tools, and technologies required for success with agile. While people and processes are critical for success, I want to switch gears a bit talk about tools and technologies.</description>

      <description>For the last few years, especially in the software development space, we&amp;#8217;ve been hearing the word &amp;#8220;agile&amp;#8221; thrown around ad nauseam. Concepts such as iterative design, adaptive planning, collaboration, self-organization, continuous delivery, and so on flood the current literature.
I&amp;#8217;ve spent the last several years working with clients to develop and improve their agile practices, improving quality and time-to-market. The result has been great for software teams and customers alike. But aren&amp;#8217;t we leaving the rest of the organization out in the cold?</description>

Change is Hard I have worked with a wide variety of client personality types over the years; some are excited, motivated and proactive about change.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been a sport shooting enthusiast for about 15 years. In that time, I&amp;#8217;ve found the most difficult skill to master is speed vs. accuracy. In a fight for one&amp;#8217;s life, this skill becomes vital &amp;#8211; hitting the right target before you exhaust your ammunition. This same balance applies to IT service delivery.
In my consulting work, I&amp;#8217;ve observed clients who have only one speed. Some clients can only deliver quickly, others slowly.</description>

      <description>​Many of my senior-executive clients have been called upon by their boards to get directly involved in technology issues. These boards are also starting to think strategically about technology, and how industry trends are shaping their companies&amp;#8217; future. More than ever, we need to ask questions that keep us focused on the right issues. While working with clients on new projects, or meeting prospective clients for the first time, I&amp;#8217;ve collected a series of &amp;#8220;must-answer&amp;#8221; questions that bring clarity to any technology strategy initiative.</description>

      <description>One of my best clients initially contacted me because they simply wanted to get faster at what they do. They needed to deliver more value to their customers more often, and at lower cost. However, they just couldn&amp;#8217;t seem to improve. When I paid them a visit, I looked at their product development lifecycle as a whole. Their product roadmap was solid, their requirements specifications and test plans were clear, the team had all the right skills, and their quality was high.</description>

      <description>With the end of the year fast approaching, my clients are now focusing like a laser what they would like to accomplish in 2016. Many are finalizing their technology strategy, investing in DevOps practices and tools, committing to Agile transformation, and leveraging the Cloud. All these efforts enable my clients to do two things they couldn&amp;#8217;t before: fail fast and pivot.
What do we mean by fail fast?
When developing new solutions with my clients, we embrace a feedback loop.</description>

      <description>Many years ago, I subcontracted on a large software project. It was an automotive warranty claims processing system. Many consultants had cycled through this organization over 3 or 4 years, none ever seeming to make a dent towards completing the project. I personally spent eighteen months on this project. Rumor has it that almost $30 million was ultimately spent, with little to show for it. Yes, you read that correctly. How do unproductive projects fester like this for so long, and with such expense?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve worked with dozens of organizations and teams making the transition to Agile &amp;#8211; specifically Scrum. The same issues constantly arise, almost always around testing. According to Scrum, a Product Backlog Item (PBI) is never done until it is potentially shippable. That means code complete, tested, and documented, with a pretty bow on top&amp;#8230;it&amp;#8217;s not just done, it&amp;#8217;s done done.
Because we work in a timebox &amp;#8211; the Sprint &amp;#8211; we have a hard date from which to work backwards, usually two weeks.</description>

      <description>Imagine a typical week of traffic to your company&amp;#8217;s web store. This pattern might look a lot like your own traffic, with a peak during the middle of the day, and a slowdown in the middle of the night.
Given this pattern, it becomes really easy to do capacity planning. We can provision, say 15% over what we see our normal peak to be, and be happy with the capacity we have for a while, so long as our traffic matches this pattern.</description>

      <description>People hate change. We have our habits, routines, and preferences that drive us to act, or in many cases fail to act.
When I engage with a new client, I spend a lot of time not only understanding their business processes, but also the rationale for those processes. It&amp;#8217;s my job to question and challenge these processes, with the goal of improving (or even removing) them to create new value for my clients.</description>

      <description>John Wayne airport in Santa Ana, California has a rather unique set of takeoff requirements. Its runway, at 5,701 feet, is one of the shortest among commercial airports in the US. A Boeing 757 is the largest airplane that can be accommodated. It also has very strict noise requirements. My cousin lives next door in quiet Irvine, and told me that airplanes must take off at full throttle, shooting off the runway like a rocket, then quickly back down the engines to keep quiet.</description>

      <description>Microsoft sucks. Java is dead. Rails can&amp;#8217;t scale. Python is slow. I&amp;#8217;ve heard it all, and I can tell you none of it matters.
Developers are an interesting breed; they tend to stick to what they know best, but also love to tinker with new technologies. These experiments often fail at the expense of a project&amp;#8217;s success, however.
Many of my clients struggle with technology choice for new projects. Business owners and executives are hesitant to try newer technologies, but by the same token don&amp;#8217;t want to be left driving an Edsel.</description>

My long-time client, a general contractor, called me this weekend with a “great idea” for some custom cloud-based software that will transform his business. I get calls like this all the time; these requests usually go something like this: Client is in pain  Build a new software system  No more pain  Profit!   This is cloudy thinking.</description>

      <description>Now that we’re in Q4, your technology strategy for 2016 should be well formed. So what’s your plan for SCAM? The Social, Cloud, Analytics, and Mobile (SCAM) stack presents a framework in which organizations can align marketing and technical efforts with a customer-centric strategy.
Social Media is the New CRM People have an innate need for affiliation. We join clubs, professional associations, play sports, and even practice our religions, to one degree or another, in order to satisfy this need.</description>

      <description>The role of CIO as Chief Infrastructure Officer is becoming increasingly irrelevant. IT budgets have shifted to Marketing. Corporate infrastructure is moving to the cloud. So what&amp;#8217;s left? Data.    Enter the Chief Data Officer    Data belongs to the business, not just to IT. The CDO represents these business interests. If the CIO&amp;#8217;s job is simply to keep the lights on, that&amp;#8217;s not something the rest of the business will relate to.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working with my best clients on integrating realtime Voice of the Customer (VoC) technologies into their e-commerce operations. The results have been enlightening and profitable!
When I first started with e-commerce systems around 2003, the industry was still in its infancy, and many customers still followed up online orders with multiple confirmation phone calls, or would use a vendor&amp;#8217;s website to get their phone number to place an order.</description>

      <description>This past Sunday around 6am ET, Amazon Web Services had a mega outage, affecting millions of customers worldwide. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon&amp;#8217;s global cloud computing infrastructure business unit. AWS powers many popular websites including Netflix, Pinterest, Expedia, IMDB, Reddit, and more. Many of my own clients rely on AWS services.
Multiple AWS systems failed simultaneously: DynamoDB, Cognito, and CloudWatch. The latter, CloudWatch, is Amazon&amp;#8217;s own cloud monitoring platform. So, the system used to monitor their own cloud went offline, unable to alert on its offline status.</description>

      <description>In my previous article, we examined the business drivers for a cloud migration. Next, let’s look at some strategies for success, and some common challenges when moving and IT organization to the cloud. 
There isn’t just one path to the cloud. When planning migrations with my clients, I present a number of proven options, with a focus on not only minimizing downtime, but also a path to growth. Most migration plans fall into one of three categories: Forklift, Refactor, or Rebuild.</description>

      <description>My best clients have been migrating their on-premise line-of-business applications to the cloud, with varying degrees of adoption. In the coming series of articles, I’ll explain some of the business drivers for this transition, high-level technical considerations, and challenges for the organization.
Part One: Business Drivers for Change
All organizations are under increasing pressure to maximize their return on technology investment. As budgets shift funds from IT to marketing, the IT organization seeks to save costs.</description>

      <description>Whether you’re an established business looking to raise the bar, or a startup delivering new technology to market, you need expert knowledge and experience to advise you. In this article, I’m going to discuss what a technology advisor does, and how you’ll be far better off working with one.
Who works with a technology advisor?
Business owners and technology executives need to make quick but informed decisions. Top line revenue growth, and bottom line profit are key drivers.</description>

      <description>While a steadily growing number of organizations have been moving their resources offshore, it still remains an involved, high-risk decision.
Most companies consider moving at least some of their workload offshore for cost reduction and “follow the sun” coverage for support staff. I’ve worked with companies of all sizes to integrate offshore teams, and what I’ve found interesting is the common challenges they have. Most notably, they cite while labor costs are lower, product quality decreases, and projects take longer to complete.</description>

      <description>I spend a lot of time working with clients on developing their Agile software development processes. These clients are usually CEOs and senior executives who need to deliver better software faster, cheaper, with higher quality and lower risk. Unfortunately, risk avoidance can result in delaying critical decision-making. When this risk aversion becomes debilitating, we have Analysis Paralysis.
Effective business leaders have clear plans and take action. However, we are constantly flooded with new ideas, alternatives, and endless potential risks.</description>

      <description>During Word War II, the US Office of War Information coined the phrase “Loose Lips Sink Ships” in an effort to mitigate the risk of leaking information to enemy spies. While this tactic is useful during wartime, it can serve to hurt your business.
What I mean here is sinking your ship from within by failing to communicate, both early and often.

      <description>For 37 million adulterers, this was a very bad week. Ashley Madison, a website catering to those seeking extramarital affairs, had its database of users hacked.
Putting aside the ethical and moral issues surrounding Ashley Madison, this event gives us an opportunity to analyze the current state of cybersecurity. What makes this case noteworthy are the following:
 The attack was ideological in nature, as opposed to most other hacks which are directed to either cause mischief and disruption, or to obtain credit card and other sensitive data.</description>

      <description>Failing at employee retention, especially in high tech, can be devastating to your business. Protect your investment by keeping your top talent from jumping ship.
Overcommunicate Employees want to feel involved. Executives should regularly communicate with employees. And I don’t mean an annual conference call with an 80-slide PowerPoint to discuss results. When I managed teams, I made calendar time for one-on-one informal chats with my staff. Even if it was just over coffee, I needed to “take their temperature”.</description>

      <description>I was recently working with a consulting client who was suffering from a productivity decline in her organization over the past year. My client, a VP of a software development organization, recently adopted Scrum as its Agile software development process. When I conducted interviews with key team members, a common complaint emerged: “Management is always ignoring the process!”
Most organizations follow some form of process, regardless of the domain. These processes range from lightweight (almost nonexistent) to the draconian.</description>

I solicited referrals from friends and colleagues, and even took to Angie’s List for a highly reviewed local company. I gave two a call, and surprisingly, both were available the same day to provide written estimates.</description>

      <description>When I meet with clients for the first time, they often present me with a project concept and requirements already defined. Measures of success are usually loose or absent, but a firm deadline is common. The client often jumps right to cost, scope, or some other set of variables they believe are of primary importance. Here I hit the brakes, and work with the client to discover the real problem the project is trying to solve.</description>

      <description>In 2010, Esther Derby wrote, “How agile you are doesn’t matter. Whether you are 50 per cent agile, 90 per cent agile or agile through and through (what ever that means), doesn’t matter. What does matter is that your company is satisfying its customers, stakeholders, and employees.”
While it’s critical to satisfy those groups in order to keep the lights on, you can’t reach the next level of performance in your business by simply remaining afloat.</description>

      <title>Alignment vs. Autonomy</title>

      <description>Alignment occurs when leaders and teams share the same values and work towards a common goal. Autonomy allows teams to work independently of leaders and each other. The stronger alignment we have, the more autonomy we can afford to grant. The leader’s job is to communicate what problem needs to be solved, and why. The team’s job is to collaborate with each other to find the best solution.

      <description>What are the top ways in which organizations fail to adopt or fully implement Scrum and/or Agile?
 &amp;#8220;It is difficult to get a person to understand something, when their salary depends on not understanding it.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Upton Sinclair
 First, let’s address the question. Agile is not something that we can implement, it is a characteristic that we try to achieve. So, we do not “do agile”, we practice techniques that help us become agile; that give us the ability to move gracefully and help us become adaptable and resourceful.</description>

 Do you know who your ideal customer is? Do you market where your ideal customer hangs out? Are you selling what your customers *really* want? Can your customer easily find you? Can your customer easily find their product of interest on your website? Do you offer multiple payment methods? Do you offer multiple shipping methods?</description>

The sledders are all top of their game, and like luge and bobsled, have very narrow parameters within which they can differentiate themselves, outperform, and claim victory. One sledder from Great Britain caught my attention &amp;#8211; Kristan Bromley.</description>

She has not yet fully embraced e-commerce, as the direct-mail channel is her bread and butter. She claimed to want to expand her business into the online channel, but didn&amp;#8217;t think it fit her traditional demographic. She&amp;#8217;s been selling to women fifty and older for over 20 years. I went on to explain that she needs to embrace a new demographic &amp;#8211; even multiple demographics &amp;#8211; across multiple channels in order to grow her business.</description>

just like any other object. They can also be returned from other functions!
&amp;lt;span class=&#34;lineno&#34;1&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;def&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;outer_func&amp;lt;/span&amp;lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;():&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;lineno&#34;2&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;def&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;inner_func&amp;lt;/span&amp;lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;():&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;lineno&#34;3&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;print&amp;lt;/span&amp;lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&#39;Inner funk!&#39;&amp;lt;/span&amp;lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;)&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;lineno&#34;4&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;return&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;inner_func&amp;lt;/span &amp;lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;# notice, no parens!&amp;lt;/span   Note the absence of parentheses when returning inner_func above.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Python Generators   
  This article is part two of my series on iterators and generators. If you haven’t read part one, or if you aren’t experienced with iterators in Python, then please start here. What are Generators?   Generators (introduced in PEP 255) extend the concept of iterators. In essence, they are iterators with “intelligence”. A generator function is effectively the next() iterator method, applied to get the next value in a sequence.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Python Iterators      While at our monthly South Florida Python meetup (which has exactly two members, Philip Schwartz and myself), the topic of iterators and generators came up. These are two core idioms in Python, and are even more ubiquitous in Python 3. However, they are often poorly understood. This introduction will be part one of a series on Python iterators and generators.  An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse a sequence of data such as a list, dictionary, or tuple, for example.</description>

      <description>Four years ago, I wrote a somewhat controversial article on hourly billing. Since then, I’ve had countless debates, championing the merits of abandoning hourly billing. I’ve educated the naïve, and changed the minds of the entrenched. This article expands on these concepts, and clarifies many of the salient attributes of Value-Based Fees.
Up on my Soapbox Most consultants have historically charged a time-based fee, usually hourly. This is a vestige of the legal and accounting professions, where huge firms like the Big Four served as the model.</description>

      <title>Why Do IT Projects Really Fail?</title>

      <description>I recently experienced my first IT project “failure” in many years. The purpose of this article is partly therapeutic, but also tutorial.
Successful IT project management is critical to enterprise success and to the career growth and success of participating executives, project managers, and project team members. In my case, I served in all three roles. Without divulging too many project details, or the identities of anyone else involved, I will take some creative license with the specifics as I recount my experience.</description>

      <title>Passing Lists as Parameters to Stored Procedures in SQL Server</title>

      <description>There is no good way to do this in SQL Server. Someday they will have an array datatype like PostgreSQL.
In SQL Server 2005 and higher, this can be done using XML, but I don’t particularly see the need for the overhead. Use the function below to split a delimited string and select from the returned table. Its also very helpful for reporting.
CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[SplitList] (@list VARCHAR(MAX), @separator VARCHAR(MAX) = &#39;;&#39;) RETURNS @table TABLE (Value VARCHAR(MAX)) AS BEGIN DECLARE @position INT, @previous INT SET @list = @list + @separator SET @previous = 1 SET @position = CHARINDEX(@separator, @list) WHILE @position &amp;gt; 0 BEGIN IF @position - @previous &amp;gt; 0 INSERT INTO @table VALUES (SUBSTRING(@list, @previous, @position - @previous)) IF @position &amp;gt;= LEN(@list) BREAK SET @previous = @position + 1 SET @position = CHARINDEX(@separator, @list, @previous) END RETURN END  To use this function, simply pass your list, and specify the desired delimiter:</description>

      <description>Hello Mark:
Thank you for contacting McDonald&amp;#8217;s and for sharing your concerns. I appreciate the opportunity to share the following information with you.
Please know that McDonald&amp;#8217;s food safety and quality assurance standards are among the highest in the industry. With extensive food safety measures in place throughout the entire supply chain process, McDonald&amp;#8217;s standards meet or exceed government requirements. McDonald&amp;#8217;s uses only 100 percent USDA-inspected ground beef in their hamburger patties.</description>

      <description>_I was quoted today in the following article in the New Times Broward-Palm Beach:_
With the spread of cloud computing, social networking, and client-based technologies, fewer and fewer of our computing tasks are taking place on our personal computers. More of them are going online &amp;#8212; into the cloud. We have more usernames and passwords to manage than ever.
The most reckless web surfers use the same login and password on dozens of sites, making themselves vulnerable to identity theft.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Value-Based Fees for Agile Software Projects</title>

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a quandary &amp;#8211; we, as value-based IT consultants, aspire to charge value-based fees for our services (how obvious!). We know that doing so requires tight scope control. As such, this often requires a detailed specification. However, this is the very waterfall model that the agile movement shuns. How do you reconcile scope control, customer satisfaction, and ever-changing requirements with value-based fees? I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s preferable &amp;#8211; or practical &amp;#8211; to do two week iterations on a value-based fee basis.</description>

      <description>Situation A: Is Faster Service Worth More?
Your computer is not working properly. You have tried to understand the problem and find a solution that you can implement yourself. Yet, after trying, you are no closer to a solution, you find the situation aggravating, and you decide that there’s no point in continuing to attempt fixing the problem yourself. Your time and attention are better spent on productive activities and should not be wasted on this computer problem any more.</description>

I. Qualifying the Prospect This is the process of determining whether the inquiry is appropriate for your business in terms of size, relevance, seriousness, and related factors. In other words, you don’t want to pursue a lead which can’t result in legitimate—and worthwhile—business.
Questions:
 Why do you think we might be a good match?
 Is there budget allocated for this project?</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;ve been reading my blog for any length of time, you know that I&amp;#8217;m an advocate of Value-Based Fees. In a nutshell, here is the value proposition to the prospective client:
 There is a cap on your investment. You know exactly what is to be spent and there are no surprises. There is never a &amp;#8220;meter running.&amp;#8221; You do not have to worry each time my help is requested that I might be here for an hour, a day, or a week.</description>

      <description>If a conservative doesn&amp;#8217;t like guns, he doesn&amp;#8217;t buy one.
If a liberal doesn&amp;#8217;t like guns, he wants all guns outlawed.
If a conservative is a vegetarian, he doesn&amp;#8217;t eat meat.
If a liberal is a vegetarian, he wants all meat products banned for everyone.
If a conservative sees a foreign threat, he thinks about how to defeat his enemy.
A liberal wonders how to surrender gracefully and still look good.</description>

      <description>Many of my colleagues in the Ruby on Rails community have been posting a “tools of the trade” blog post, covering their hardware and software preferences. Now that I am nearly Microsoft-free, I figured I&amp;#8217;d update my list.
Hardware
 Apple Mac Pro 8-core Xeon, 10GB RAM, 320GB + 500GB 7200rpm SATA drives. This is my main box and the best computer I&amp;#8217;ve ever owned. I use the 500GB drive as my Time Machine backup drive, but I am looking into other backup options as Time Machine is slow and there are anecdotal reliability issues, but now that I&amp;#8217;m running Snow Leopard, I haven&amp;#8217;t experienced any (not that I&amp;#8217;ve attempted a restore yet either).</description>

      <description>Alan Weiss developed this list with managing partners from accounting practices in a half-dozen countries while working with them in Atlanta this week. He thinks it applies to all professional services firms&amp;#8217; principles, and to all entrepreneurs who seek to be a &amp;#8220;trusted advisor.&amp;#8221;
How to be perceived as a Trusted Advisor:
 Do pro bono work in the community. Publish with third-party endorsement (e.g., business publications). Speak at every opportunity when there are influence leaders in the audience.</description>

      <description>In the process of creating Obox Signature Series Themes, David had to create a shopping cart system (custom built&amp;#8230; why? we dont know), so that involved a design.
But before David could design it, he had to visualise this beast in his head and get it onto paper. So since he loves wireframing so much, and talks about it often, he decided to film the whole process from start to finish.</description>

But I&amp;#8217;m sure &amp;#8216;how do I find clients?&amp;#8217; is a huge component of your workshop, so I do not presume to receive such a detailed response to that one.  &amp;#8220;It is quite obvious to me now that I have been trying to sell not only what I do, but very specifically how I do it (right down to promoting my toolset of choice).</description>

      <description>Part two of my online discussions with David Winch:-
&amp;#8220;While I understand the concept behind value-based fees, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to wrap my head around how to apply them to what I consider highly commoditized services. That is not to say I devalue my own worth, but I do recognize that there is an upper bound to what someone is willing to pay for a service, regardless of ROI &amp;#8211; price elasticity of demand.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago David Winch noticed me talking on Twitter about &amp;#8220;Determining Value-Based Fees for Software Projects&amp;#8221;
Specifically I said:
 &amp;#8220;While I generally agree that Value-Based Fees (a la Alan Weiss) are the best way to charge and get what you&amp;#8217;re worth as a consultant, I don&amp;#8217;t know how well this approach translates to the software development domain.
&amp;#8220;How do you determine value to the client without spending inordinate time performing requirements discovery and analysis?</description>

      <description>SOAP based web services and Cocoa have never been good friends, and although REST based webservices are fortunately today&amp;#8217;s standard there are still tons of SOAP-based ones out there. What has always been missing in Cocoa is high level support for interacting with SOAP-based webservices. Here I describe one way in which you can build such frameworks yourself, starting by analysing the webservice calls in detail in this part 1 and generating the necessary Cocoa classes for use in a Mac or iPhone application next time.</description>

      <description>Apple&amp;#8217;s Director of Engineering of Unix Technologies Jordan Hubbard spoke at LISA &amp;#8217;08 last week. LISA (or Large Installation System Administration Conference) is a technical conference targeted at engineers and system administrators. This year&amp;#8217;s conference invited Apple&amp;#8217;s Jordan Hubbard to speak about the evolution of Mac OS X from large servers to embedded platforms. While technical readers may find the content of Hubbard&amp;#8217;s presentation slides (PDF) quite interesting, the most surprising revelation is a more specific target date for Apple&amp;#8217;s Mac OS X 10.</description>

&amp;#8220;Growing up as an upper-middle class, Jewish boy in New York City, I had almost no other choice than to pretend to be a liberal. My high school was a hippie nest. Instead of Fs, I got hugs if I didn&amp;#8217;t know how to spell my name.</description>

      <description>A young woman was about to finish her first year of college. Like so many others her age, she considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat, and among other liberal ideals, was very much in favor of higher taxes to support more government programs, in other words, redistribution of wealth.
She was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch Republican, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she felt that her father had for years harbored an evil, selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his.</description>

      <description>Style Sheets can be associated with an XML document by using a processing instruction whose target is xml-stylesheet. It looks something like this:
&amp;lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;ISO-8859-1&#34;?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;?xml-stylesheet type=&#34;text/xsl&#34; href=&#34;something.xsl&#34;?&amp;gt; How do we get to_xml to render the XSL processing instruction? Put this in your controller:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been looking forward to this since I started working with Ruby and Rails. As a long time SOAP expert, I was disappointed by soap4r and the obvious absence of WS-* imeplementations in the Ruby world. Now, it looks like I can finally start abandoning WCF and get down to some serious productivity.
WSO2 Web Services Framework for Ruby (WSO2 WSF/Ruby), is an open source, enterprise grade, Ruby extension for providing and consuming Web Services in Ruby.</description>

      <description>Gitosis is now deprecated. Check out Gitolite instead.  I’m switching all my personal projects to gitfrom Subversion. To that end, I&amp;#8217;ve set up a remote git repository on my Linode.comVPS running Ubuntu. Here&amp;#8217;s how to do it:  First, install git on the remote server: sudo apt-get install git-core   Then, following instructions on scie.nti.st, we grab the gitosis code (still remote): cd ~/src git clone git://eagain.net/gitosis.git   Then: cd gitosis sudo apt-get install python-setuptools sudo python setup.</description>

LINQ to SQL compiler error CS1519: Invalid token &amp;#8216;void&amp;#8217; in class, struct, or interface member declaration
After a few minutes of cursing Microsoft, I figured it out&amp;#8230;looks like the compiler version wasn&amp;#8217;t updated in the solution</description>

      <description>Ever need to generate thousands of names to use as test data?
I just created an Excel sheet that uses the 1990 US census data to generate random male and female names.
Columns:
A: Male First Name
B: Female First Name
C: Last Name
E: Male Full Name (Proper Case)
F: Female Full (Proper Case)
Columns A,B,C are ordered by descending popularity. It’s limited to 65,536 names (an Excel limitation), but this should work for seeding names in just about any database you’ll need.</description>

      <description>Apparently, living in the south (if South Florida counts as &amp;#8220;the south&amp;#8221;) has finally infected my linguistic profile by 20%. This is quite depressing, as I have always prided myself in my untarnished Brooklynese. According to this Blogthing, my profile is as such:
  Your Linguistic Profile:     55% General American English    25% Yankee    20% Dixie    0% Midwestern    0% Upper Midwestern    Take the test yourself: http://www.</description>

      <description>Many would be surprised to learn some of the great things about Pope John Paul II written by Rabbi Marc Gellman (Temple Beth Torah in Melville, NY). Here&amp;#8217;s an excerpt that has reshaped my opinion of the late Karol Wojtyla:

      <description>I frequently need to store and retrieve object state. I&amp;#8217;ve found the .NET Framework&amp;#8217;s XmlSerializer invaluable in this capacity. To make my life even easier, I&amp;#8217;ve come up with a pair of functions that serialize and deserialize an arbitrary object to an XML file.
I&amp;#8217;ve stripped out comments, exception handling, etc. for brevity&amp;#8217;s sake.
