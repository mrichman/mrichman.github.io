&lt;p&gt;I can help you transform your business and deliver high-performing applications, faster and more economically than with on-premises solutions. My Amazon Web Services (AWS) migration services include: strategy and roadmap, infrastructure audit, architecture design, automation, deployment, testing, cutover and disaster recovery planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating a single application to AWS can seem simple. Sometimes it is. But more often, that application’s function is tied to multiple business processes and dependencies. It may impact your vendors, your balance sheet, your regulatory compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a simple &amp;ldquo;forklift&amp;rdquo; approach to moving your applications to the cloud often bypasses the key benefits associated with the cloud: cost savings, scalability, increased speed and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re contemplating a cloud migration of 100 or 1,000 applications, the missed opportunities and potential pitfalls can pile up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS migrations involve a very complex set of distributed activities that need to be managed deliberately and with agility. I will work with you to rapidly map applications and infrastructure as well as to determine the right migration path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;amazon-web-services-aws-migration-planning&#34;&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) Migration Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what you get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An initial in-depth, one-on-one remote meeting with me to define long-term business goals, existing legacy systems architecture, and organizational challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A thorough analysis of your current infrastructure, including any architecturally significant use cases, as they may relate to AWS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will provide a custom report and roadmap, detailing the specific migration path from your on-premises solution to AWS, step-by-step. This will include complete specifications for compute resources, storage, databases, networking, security, usage fees, and any other necessary &amp;ldquo;moving parts&amp;rdquo; to get you up and running on AWS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A closing phone or Skype call to go over the results and reports, talk about your strategy again and make sure that we have everything covered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can optionally present a separate proposal to personally implement the migration plan with you and your staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My one-time fee for AWS Migration Planning is $4,500 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&#34;/contact&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; to sign up or for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-strategy-retainer&#34;&gt;Cloud Strategy Retainer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud-based applications are not simply “forklifted” versions of their on-premises cousins; in fact, cloud application platforms are far more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning things the hard way in the cloud means wasting tens (or sometimes hundreds) of thousands of dollars on misguided development efforts. Worse, you risk losing valuable competitive advantage by prolonging your time to market. Our consulting engagement will give you access to the strategic and tactical cloud expertise you need, when you need it. &lt;a href=&#34;/services/strategy-retainer&#34;&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud-based applications are not simply “forklifted” versions of their on-premises cousins; in fact, cloud application platforms are far more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning things the hard way in the cloud means wasting tens (or sometimes hundreds) of thousands of dollars on misguided development efforts. Worse, you risk losing valuable competitive advantage by prolonging your time to market. Our consulting engagement will give you access to the strategic and tactical cloud expertise you need, when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-it-work&#34;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our agreement entitles you to unlimited 24/7 access to me via phone, email, and IM. I return all messages no later than the next business day, although in practice response time is much quicker (particularly between 9am to 5pm ET, but also nights and weekends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings are scheduled in advance, typically take place over the phone, and are sometimes supplemented with online meeting and/or screen sharing software (e.g. GoToMeeting, Skype, Join.me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 6 possible areas of involvement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participation in an initial in-depth, in-person meeting to define long-term business goals, existing legacy systems architecture, and organizational challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular meetings with the primary project contact to discuss strategy, longer-term issues, and business goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic and tactical advice based on a series of ongoing meetings with team leaders. These are individualized and mutually agreed upon. In addition, I&amp;rsquo;ll serve as a sounding board as they work to achieve their business and technical goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical review of APIs, IDEs, source code, documentation, and the like. Where appropriate, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide code samples, proof-of-concept examples, and design mockups. Please note that authoring shipping code, designs, or documentation is not included in this agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodic competitive analysis and market insight based on interactions with the developer community, both in person (e.g. speaking engagements, meet-ups, user groups), and online (e.g. Twitter, RSS feeds, blog posts/comments, mailing lists).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situational responsiveness to needs that arise that you deem require my assistance, which are not covered elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fee is $10,000 USD per month, all inclusive (i.e., I arrange and pay for any necessary travel, administrative expenses, etc). Professional courtesy discounts are available for quarterly and annual arrangements. Participation is extremely limited. You can elect to be added to the waiting list if spots are not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&#34;/contact&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; to sign up or for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
