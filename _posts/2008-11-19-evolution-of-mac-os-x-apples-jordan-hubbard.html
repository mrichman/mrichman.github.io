Apple's Director of Engineering of Unix Technologies Jordan Hubbard spoke at <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa08/tech/">LISA '08</a> last week. LISA (or Large Installation System Administration Conference) is a technical conference targeted at engineers and system administrators. This year's conference <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/c.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenix.org%2Fevents%2Flisa08%2Ftech%2F&amp;t=1227094201">invited</a> Apple's Jordan Hubbard to speak about the evolution of Mac OS X from large servers to embedded platforms. While technical readers may find the content of Hubbard's <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/c.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenix.org%2Fevents%2Flisa08%2Ftech%2Fhubbard_talk.pdf&amp;t=1227094201">presentation slides (PDF)</a> quite interesting, the most surprising revelation is a more specific target date for Apple's Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard): 1st Quarter 2009.
