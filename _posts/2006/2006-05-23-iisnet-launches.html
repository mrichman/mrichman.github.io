This morning, Microsoft opened to the public a website dedicated to IIS - <a href="http://www.iis.net">www.iis.net</a>.<br />You'll find forums, whitepapers, webcasts and more all in one place. In addition, a great deal of information about IIS 7 has been placed here. This includes, hands on virtual labs of IIS7, walkthroughs, FAQs and more. Much of it has not been available to the general public until now.
