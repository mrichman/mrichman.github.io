I actually bought <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/bookSearch/isbnInquiry.asp?sourceid=00413492336242956954&ISBN=0316159727&amp;bfdate=12-27-2004+10:13:18">this book</a> before I found the <a href="http://www.vidlit.com/yidlit/">website</a>. Even if you don't speak much Yiddish, it's hysterical...so funny, you could <span style="font-style: italic;">plotz</span>!
