<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP_%28protocol%29">SOAP</a> based web services and Cocoa have never been good friends, and although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a> based webservices are fortunately today's standard there are still tons of SOAP-based ones out there. What has always been missing in Cocoa is high level support for interacting with SOAP-based webservices. Here I describe one way in which you can build such frameworks yourself, starting by analysing the webservice calls in detail in this part 1 and generating the necessary Cocoa classes for use in a Mac or iPhone application next time.
