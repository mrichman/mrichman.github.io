Now that I no longer work for an [oppressive organization](http://bit.ly/1bPIymy "Go ahead, sue me!") who aggressively monitors and censors employee-created content, I will be resuming my blogging activities.  

This website uses the amazing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static site generator, and is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com).  

I generally write on technical topics, but I may, from time to time, post content related to my other interests.
