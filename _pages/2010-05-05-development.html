<h3>Application Development</h3>
<strong>With over 15 years of experience in web application   development spanning multiple operating systems and application frameworks, I am an  expert in implementing solutions to solve your business problems.</strong>

I can help your business with application  development needs in  a number of ways; complimenting your current  development staff or by  letting you outsource the entire project to me.
<h3>Why do I use <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>?</h3>
First, you might be wondering: Web application frameworks are a dime a dozen, so what's different about Rails?  Here are a few things that make <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> stand above the crowd:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Full-Stack Web Framework.</strong> <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> is an MVC web framework where models, views, and controllers are fully integrated in a seamless fashion.  That means you automatically get all the benefits of an MVC design without the hassle of explicitly configuring each component to play well with the others.</li>
	<li><strong>Real-World Usage.</strong> The <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> framework was extracted from real-world web applications.  That is, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> comes from real need, not anticipating what might be needed.  The result is an easy to use and cohesive framework that's rich in functionality, and at the same time it does its best to stay out of your way.</li>
	<li><strong>One Language: Ruby.</strong> Everything from business logic to configuration files (there aren't many) are written in the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org" target="_blank">Ruby Progamming Language</a>.  With just one language, you hope it's a good one, and Ruby doesn't disappoint.  Ruby is a full object-oriented language with clean syntax and it has a way of
making programming truly fun.  Using one language means you don't have to juggle between multiple languages and dialects as you're building your application.</li>
	<li><strong>Convention over Configuration.</strong> <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> works hard to take care of all the repetitive and error-prone chores associated with starting to build a web application, and maintaining it over time.  <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> uses simple naming conventions and clever use of reflection to make your work easier with near-zero configuration.</li>
	<li><strong>It's Productive!</strong> At the end of the day, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> is all about helping you stay productive.  And in a world where being the first to market and keeping customers happy adds up to increased revenues for you, it pays to pick a tool aligned with those goals. Many <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/applications">real-world applications</a> are already reaping the benefits.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Project rescue</h3>
<strong>Have a project or product that is spiraling  out of control?   Are deadlines consistently missed, communication almost  non-existent  and surprises popping up everywhere you turn?</strong>

If any of those questions resonate with you your  project might be in  need of a rescue and it can help to have an  objective, fresh set of  eyes take a look. Project Rescues are broken up  into a series of  discrete phases but almost all include discovery and  recommendations.  Who implements those recommendations is left to you. I  can help train  or kickstart an existing team.

One critical step after recommendations, however, is buy-in. You’ve   paid to ﬁnd out what the issues are and how to ﬁx them, or have them   ﬁxed. You have to be committed to enabling those recommendations to be   implemented before we would continue.
