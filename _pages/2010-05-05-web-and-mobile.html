<strong>I create robust standards-based web and mobile applications using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.</strong>

"What about the App Store?!" you may ask?

Here's why I prefer to build HTML5 web apps, instead of an iPhone or iPad native app.
<ol>
	<li>Rapid iteration. If you want a new feature tonight, you get it  tonight. No waiting three weeks for you to get through Apple's approval process.</li>
	<li>It prepares systems for building native apps if you should ever <strong>really</strong> want one. Why? Because  apps can include a Safari browser instance inside, so all of this work  is reusable.</li>
	<li>It’s easier to build and debug because you don’t need to do a lot of  specialized coding to make the native app work properly.</li>
	<li>Yes, mobile web apps <strong>can</strong> run when disconnected from the web! <a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/SafariJSDatabaseGuide/OfflineApplicationCache/OfflineApplicationCache.html" target="_blank">Read more...</a></li>
	<li>Another benefit to HTML5 that is that your app will also run on millions of other smartphones out there, like  the <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Android-2-0-Available-Today-Android-2-1-Next-126330.shtml" target="_blank">Droid</a> and the <a href="http://mypre.com/palm-pre-gets-html5-google-maps-app-offline-webapps-200918613/" target="_blank">Pre</a> - instead of just on the iPhone.</li>
</ol>
