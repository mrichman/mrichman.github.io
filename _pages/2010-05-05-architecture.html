<strong>I've spent the past 15 years working with some of the highest traffic websites, web hosting companies, and secure financial institutions to create robust system architectures.</strong>

Every system I design is based on the following tenets:
<ul>
	<li>Security</li>
	<li>Performance</li>
	<li>Scalability</li>
	<li>Multi-tenancy</li>
	<li>Fault Tolerance</li>
	<li>Disaster recovery</li>
</ul>
